# Local Store project '23
	For the final exam, I create laravel/react + c# destop application
	In order to running a small shop, I came up with a website and a desktop application.
	At the same time, the Website is an online shop, later on it can even completely replace the desktop application.
	The desktop application manages the store (User management, Product management, Suppliers, etc...).

### Used programs and extensions

- Visual Studio 2022
- PhStorm
- MySQL Workbench
- MS Office
- Laragon
- Pichon
- DevToys
- ColorPicker
- laravel
- react
- react-router-dom
- react-bootstrap
- bootstrap
- styled
- react-phone-number-input
- @emailjs/browser

### Launch web application

The project must be copied to the C: drive, as this is the only way the application will be able to handle the images. Copy the command below and the folder structure will be created

```bash
cd c:

```

```bash
mkdir laragon\www\Vizsgamunka_23_v2\Vizsgamunka_v2\

```

Copying a project (Clone) (It must be copied to the folder created above!!!)

```bash
git@github.com:HCBlaze/Vizsgamunka_v2.git

```

Then we navigate to the Web application folder
```bash
cd "Webes alkalmazas"

```
In the web application folder, there is an .env file where the data related to the database must be entered! (e.g. password)


Install NPM

```bash
npm install

```

Start server (I used Laragon)

The page is available in a web browser on localhost or at Vizsgamunka_23_v2.test.

### Launch desktop application
This git repository (c:\laragon\www\Vizsgamunka_23_v2\Vizsgamunka_v2\) must be in the folder structure mentioned above, this is the only way the program can find the images.

Download the application installer (documentation can also be found here)

```bash
Google drive link ---> if you need contact me via e-mail  

```	
- Install fonts included in a folder
- I wrote the application in such a way that a mysql database must be run on the local machine.
- The database does not need to be created, by importing the attached .sql file you will create the database, the tables and the test data as well!
- Run installer (.exe).
- After installation, the local mysql data must be set. There is a connectionString.txt file in the program's library, the corresponding data must be rewritten here.
- Then we can start the program.
- In order for all functions of the program to work, you will need MS Office and a .pdf viewing program.
